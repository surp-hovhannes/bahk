- **Django**: 4.2.11 with all required packages installed
- **Celery**: 5.5.3 properly configured
- **django-celery-beat**: 2.8.1 for periodic tasks

### ✅ Service Status
- **Redis Server**: Running and responding to ping
- **Celery Worker**: Started and operational (1 node online)
- **Celery Beat Scheduler**: Started for periodic task scheduling
- **Django System**: Passes system checks (2 non-critical warnings)

## Background Agent Configuration

### Celery Setup
- **Broker URL**: `redis://localhost:6379/0`
- **Result Backend**: `redis://localhost:6379/1`
- **Worker Concurrency**: 1 (suitable for development)
- **Task Discovery**: Automatic across all Django apps
- **SSL Support**: Configured for production environments

### Scheduled Tasks Configured
1. **Daily Fast Notifications** - Runs daily at midnight
2. **Hourly Fast Map Updates** - Runs every hour
3. **Sentry Monitoring** - Integrated for task monitoring

### Available Apps with Background Tasks
- `hub` - Core application features
- `notifications` - Push notification system
- `app_management` - Application management
- `learning_resources` - Content management

## Verification Tests Performed

### ✅ System Checks
```bash
python manage.py check
# Result: PASSED with 2 non-critical warnings
```

### ✅ Redis Connectivity
```bash
redis-cli ping
# Result: PONG (Redis responding)
```

### ✅ Celery Worker Communication
```bash
celery -A bahk inspect ping
# Result: celery@cursor: OK - pong (1 node online)
```

### ✅ Active Process Verification
```bash
ps aux | grep celery
# Result: Both worker and beat processes running
```

## Background Agent Capabilities

The background agent can now handle:
- **Asynchronous task processing** via Celery workers
- **Periodic task scheduling** via Celery beat
- **Email notifications** via Mailgun integration
- **Push notifications** via Expo SDK
- **Map generation and updates** using geospatial libraries
- **API integrations** with OpenAI and Anthropic
- **File processing** with S3 storage support

## Production Readiness

### Procfile Configuration
The application includes proper Procfile for deployment:
```
web: gunicorn bahk.wsgi --log-file -
worker: celery -A bahk worker --loglevel=info
beat: celery -A bahk beat --loglevel=info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

### Monitoring & Error Tracking
- **Sentry Integration**: Configured for both Django and Celery
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Set up for all application components
- **Health Checks**: Available via Celery inspect commands

## Next Steps

The background agent is fully operational and ready for:
1. **Development**: All background tasks can be developed and tested
2. **Deployment**: Ready for production deployment with included Procfile
3. **Scaling**: Can be scaled horizontally by adding more worker processes
4. **Monitoring**: Integrated monitoring provides visibility into task execution

## Commands for Background Agent Management

### Start Services
```bash
# Start Redis (if not already running)
redis-server --daemonize yes

# Start Celery Worker
celery -A bahk worker --loglevel=info

# Start Celery Beat Scheduler
celery -A bahk beat --loglevel=info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

### Monitor Services
```bash
# Check worker status
celery -A bahk inspect ping

# View active tasks
celery -A bahk inspect active

# Monitor task statistics
celery -A bahk inspect stats
```
