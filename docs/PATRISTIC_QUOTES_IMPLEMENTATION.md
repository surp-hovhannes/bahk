# Patristic Quotes Feature Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete multilingual patristic quotes feature with the following capabilities:

- **Multilingual support** (English/Armenian) using modeltrans
- **Multiple church assignment** (quotes can belong to multiple churches)
- **Multiple fast assignment** (quotes can be associated with multiple fasts)
- **Tagging system** using django-taggit
- **Markdown support** for quote text
- **Deterministic "Quote of the Day"** endpoint that ensures all users see the same quote each day

## Files Created

### 1. Model (`/app/hub/models.py`)
- Added `PatristicQuote` model with:
  - `text` (TextField) - Markdown content
  - `attribution` (CharField) - Author/source
  - `churches` (ManyToManyField) - Multiple church assignment
  - `fasts` (ManyToManyField) - Multiple fast assignment
  - `tags` (TaggableManager) - Tag support
  - `i18n` fields for text and attribution (English/Armenian)
  - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

### 2. Admin Interface (`/app/hub/admin.py`)
- Added `PatristicQuoteAdmin` class extending `MarkdownxModelAdmin`
- Features:
  - Markdown editor for quote text
  - Multilingual field support
  - Church and fast links display
  - Tag management
  - Search and filtering capabilities

### 3. Serializer (`/app/hub/serializers.py`)
- Added `PatristicQuoteSerializer` with:
  - Full field serialization
  - Tag list serialization
  - Church and fast names
  - Multilingual translation support

### 4. Views (`/app/hub/views/patristic_quotes.py`)
Created 5 API endpoints:

1. **PatristicQuoteListView** - List all quotes with filtering
   - Filter by: search, church, fast, tags
   - Supports pagination

2. **PatristicQuoteDetailView** - Get single quote details

3. **PatristicQuotesByChurchView** - Filter quotes by church

4. **PatristicQuotesByFastView** - Filter quotes by fast

5. **PatristicQuoteOfTheDayView** - Deterministic quote of the day
   - Uses MD5 hashing for deterministic selection
   - Ensures same quote for all users on same day
   - Supports filtering by fast_id and tags
   - 24-hour caching
   - Timezone-aware for authenticated users

### 5. URL Configuration (`/app/hub/urls.py`)
Added URL patterns:
- `patristic-quotes/` - List view
- `patristic-quotes/<id>/` - Detail view
- `patristic-quotes/by-church/<church_id>/` - Filter by church
- `patristic-quotes/by-fast/<fast_id>/` - Filter by fast
- `patristic-quotes/quote-of-the-day/` - Quote of the day

### 6. Tests (`/app/hub/tests/test_patristic_quotes.py`)
Comprehensive test suite with 24 tests covering:
- Model creation and validation
- Multiple churches/fasts assignment
- Tag functionality
- Multilingual translations
- API endpoints (list, detail, filtering)
- Quote of the day deterministic behavior
- Caching functionality
- Edge cases and error handling

### 7. Migration (`/app/hub/migrations/0037_patristicquote.py`)
Database migration created and applied successfully

## API Endpoints

### 1. List Quotes
```
GET /api/patristic-quotes/
Query params: search, church, fast, tags, lang
```

### 2. Get Quote Detail
```
GET /api/patristic-quotes/{id}/
Query params: lang
```

### 3. Filter by Church
```
GET /api/patristic-quotes/by-church/{church_id}/
Query params: tags, lang
```

### 4. Filter by Fast
```
GET /api/patristic-quotes/by-fast/{fast_id}/
Query params: tags, lang
```

### 5. Quote of the Day
```
GET /api/patristic-quotes/quote-of-the-day/
Query params: fast_id, tags, lang
```

## Quote of the Day Algorithm

The deterministic quote selection ensures all users see the same quote:

1. Get current date in user's timezone (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Create seed string: `{date}-{fast_id}-{sorted_tags}`
3. Hash seed using MD5
4. Convert hash to integer
5. Apply modulo operation on quote count
6. Select quote at calculated index
7. Cache result for 24 hours

This guarantees:
- Same quote for all users on a given day
- Different quotes on different days
- Consistent selection for same filters
- Efficient caching to reduce database load

## Admin Features

Admins can:
- Create/edit patristic quotes with Markdown editor
- Add English and Armenian translations
- Assign quotes to multiple churches
- Assign quotes to multiple fasts (optional)
- Add tags for categorization
- Search quotes by text or attribution
- Filter by churches, fasts, or tags
- View creation/update timestamps

## Testing

All 24 tests pass successfully:
```bash
python manage.py test hub.tests.test_patristic_quotes --settings=tests.test_settings
```

Test coverage includes:
- ✅ Model creation and relationships
- ✅ Multilingual translations
- ✅ Tag functionality
- ✅ API endpoints (list, detail, filtering)
- ✅ Quote of the day deterministic behavior
- ✅ Caching functionality
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

## Usage Examples

### Create a Quote (Admin)
```python
from hub.models import PatristicQuote, Church, Fast

quote = PatristicQuote.objects.create(
    text='**Prayer** is the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening.',
    attribution='Mahatma Gandhi'
)
quote.churches.add(church1, church2)
quote.fasts.add(fast1)
quote.tags.add('prayer', 'discipline')
```

### API Request Examples

**Get all quotes:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/patristic-quotes/

```

**Get Armenian translation:**
