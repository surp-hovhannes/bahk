# User Events Tracking System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive user events tracking system for your Django application. This system provides flexible, scalable event tracking with automatic signal-based tracking for key user actions, user activity feeds, automated Celery tasks, and comprehensive admin/API interfaces for analytics.

## ðŸš€ What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Models (`events/models.py`)

**EventType Model:**
- Configurable event types with categories (user_action, system_event, milestone, notification, analytics)
- Pre-defined event types for all requested scenarios:
  - `user_joined_fast` / `user_left_fast`
  - `fast_beginning` / `fast_ending`
  - `devotional_available`
  - `fast_participant_milestone`
  - `user_milestone_reached` (for future milestones feature)
  - `user_logged_in` / `user_logged_out`
  - `fast_created` / `fast_updated`
  - `article_published` / `recipe_published` / `video_published` (learning resources)

**Event Model:**
- Flexible event tracking with Generic Foreign Keys for target objects
- JSON data field for event-specific information
- User association (nullable for system events)
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Automatic title generation
- Comprehensive validation

**UserActivityFeed Model:**
- User-facing activity feed system
- Rich data storage for different activity types
- Automatic creation from events via signals
- Retention policy management (automatic cleanup)
- Read/unread status tracking
- Activity type categorization

**UserMilestone Model:**
- Individual user achievement tracking
- Prevents duplicate milestone awards
- Generic foreign key support for related objects
- Automatic activity feed integration
- Currently tracks: first fast join, first non-weekly fast completion

### 2. Automatic Event Tracking (`events/signals.py`)

**Django Signals Integration:**
- **Fast Join/Leave**: Automatically tracks when users join or leave fasts via Profile.fasts relationship
- **User Milestones**: Awards first fast join milestones immediately when users join their first fast
- **Fast Creation/Updates**: Tracks when fasts are created or modified
- **User Login/Logout**: Tracks authentication events
- **Milestone Tracking**: Utility functions for participation milestones (10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 participants)
- **Learning Resources**: Automatic tracking when articles, recipes, and videos are published
- **Devotional Availability**: Date-based tracking when devotionals become available

**Utility Functions:**
- `track_fast_participant_milestone()` - Check and track participation milestones
- `track_devotional_available()` - Track when devotionals become available
- `track_fast_beginning()` / `track_fast_ending()` - Track fast lifecycle events
- `check_and_track_participation_milestones()` - Convenient wrapper for milestone checking
- `track_article_published()` / `track_recipe_published()` / `track_video_published()` - Learning resource tracking

### 3. Celery Tasks (`events/tasks.py`)

**Automated Event Tracking Tasks:**
- `track_fast_participant_milestone_task()` - Asynchronous milestone tracking
- `track_fast_beginning_task()` - Asynchronous fast beginning tracking
- `track_devotional_availability_task()` - Asynchronous devotional availability tracking
- `track_article_published_task()` / `track_recipe_published_task()` / `track_video_published_task()` - Learning resource tracking

**Scheduled Tasks (Celery Beat):**
- `check_fast_beginning_events_task()` - Daily check for fasts starting today (6 AM)
- `check_participation_milestones_task()` - Daily check for participation milestones (8 AM)
- `check_devotional_availability_task()` - Daily check for devotional availability (7 AM)
- `check_completed_fast_milestones_task()` - Daily check for user milestone awards (3 AM)
- `cleanup_old_activity_feed_items_task()` - Daily cleanup of old feed items (2 AM)

**Activity Feed Tasks:**
- `create_activity_feed_item_task()` - Create feed items from events
- `batch_create_activity_feed_items_task()` - Batch processing for performance
- `populate_user_activity_feed_task()` - Backfill historical data
- `cleanup_old_activity_feed_items_task()` - Retention policy enforcement

### 4. Admin Interface (`events/admin.py`)

**Comprehensive Admin Panel:**
- **EventType Management**: Full CRUD for event types with event counts
- **Event Viewing**: Read-only event browser with advanced filtering
- **UserActivityFeed Management**: Feed item management with retention policy controls
- **UserMilestone Management**: View user achievements (read-only to prevent manual creation)
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Custom analytics view with:
  - Event statistics (total, last 24h/7d/30d)
  - Top event types
  - Events by day visualization
  - Fast join/leave trends
  - Recent milestones
  - Activity feed statistics
- **CSV Export**: Export events and activity feeds for external analysis
- **User-friendly displays**: Links to related objects, formatted data, age displays

### 5. API Endpoints (`events/views.py` & `events/urls.py`)

**REST API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/events/events/` - List events with filtering
- `GET /api/events/events/{id}/` - Event details
- `GET /api/events/events/my/` - Current user's events
- `GET /api/events/event-types/` - List event types
- `GET /api/events/stats/` - Overall statistics
- `GET /api/events/stats/user/` - Current user stats
- `GET /api/events/stats/user/{id}/` - Specific user stats (staff only)
- `GET /api/events/stats/fast/{id}/` - Fast-specific statistics
- `POST /api/events/admin/trigger-milestone/{fast_id}/` - Manual milestone check (admin only)

**Activity Feed API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/events/activity-feed/` - User's activity feed
- `GET /api/events/activity-feed/summary/` - Feed summary statistics
- `POST /api/events/activity-feed/mark-read/` - Mark items as read
- `POST /api/events/activity-feed/mark-all-read/` - Mark all items as read

**API Features:**
- **Filtering**: By user, event type, target type, target ID, date range, read status
- **Permissions**: Authenticated users only, staff-only endpoints for sensitive data
- **Comprehensive Stats**: User activity, fast analytics, trend data, feed statistics
- **Optimized Queries**: Select/prefetch related objects for performance

### 6. Management Commands (`events/management/commands/`)

**`init_event_types` Command:**
- Initializes all default event types
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Shows current event type status with emojis
- Run with: `python manage.py init_event_types`

**`populate_activity_feeds` Command:**
- Backfills user activity feeds with historical event data

```

### Manual Event Creation

```python
from events.models import Event, EventType

# Create a custom event
Event.create_event(
    event_type_code=EventType.USER_JOINED_FAST,
    user=request.user,
    target=fast,
    data={'custom_field': 'value'},

UserActivityFeed.create_fast_reminder(user, fast, 'fast_reminder')

# Create a devotional reminder feed item
UserActivityFeed.create_devotional_reminder(user, devotional, fast)

# Create from an event
UserActivityFeed.create_from_event(event, user)
```

### Milestone Tracking

```python

# Check milestones after someone joins a fast
check_and_track_participation_milestones(fast)
```

### User Milestone Creation

```python
from events.models import UserMilestone
